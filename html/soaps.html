            <h2 class='item-head'>Castile Extra Thick Liquid Soap</h2>
            <h4 class='item-subhead'>Base is:   Gluten Free    Vegan Friendly</h4>
            <h4 class='item-subhead'>Base is:     Made with Certified Organic Oils</h4>
            <p>     In times past, castile soap was made of three simple ingredients: water, olive oil and lye. In fact, when people spoke of castile soap, they were literally referencing the region of Castile, which was where their special grade of oil was pressed.  Today there are very few soap makers who manufacture a true castile soap.  You can tell the difference by the ingredients.  If extra virgin olive oil is the first or only oil ingredient, then you have a castile soap.  If the first oil ingredient is coconut or any other type of oil, you do not have a castile soap.  True castile soap is much more expensive to maufacture than a base made with coconut oil.  This is obviously due to the fact that extra virgin olive oil is much more expensive per pound than a cheap grade of coconut or palm oil.



     We have attempted to take the best of both worlds, providing a soap that is using a super high ratio of extra virgin olive oil, with a small amount of coconut oil -- you still get the benefits of castile, with an extra kick of lather from the coconut oil.  Having said that, this base is not super lathering.  It is afterall, a true castile soap.  It will still build lather, especially if you use a net, loofa, sea sponge or even a washrag.

This product is thick, meaning it has "body" to it, so that it doesn't just slip through your fingers, like some natural soaps do. It's light yellow-opaque in color, due to the high amount of pure olive oil that we use during the manufacturing process. This base can be scented with either fragrance oils or essential oils.

A few creative ideas for this liquid base are:

*Add seeds, pumice powder, ground walnut or apricot shells and you have a body / facial scrub. Just remember to use the "lightest weight" product you can find, so that the bits don't sink to the bottom of your jar.

*Thin this base down with water or hydrosol waters and you have a thinner version -- that is slightly scented (if you use hydrosol waters).

*Add small amounts of silk amino acids, wheat protein, oat protein, etc. for a customized soap that is even kinder to the skin.

​

Remember ... this is a natural soap - so it will sting your eyes if it comes in contact with them. So use caution in that regard.</p>
            <p>Ingredients:  Filtered water, * extra virgin Olea europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, * Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, ^ potassium hydroxide, ** sodium alginate.

            <h4 class='item-subhead'>Base is 100% Pure & Natural</h4>
            <p>     This translucent glycerin soap base is one of the purest and most natural products you can find. We've added fresh honey to this blend, to give this base an even more skin soothing benefit. Honey is naturally antibacterial, and often used in acne related washes.



     This soap has a high glycerin content which means it will leave your skin feeling naturally soft and not chemically stripped.

We use no chemicals nor surfactants in our soap bases. For this reason, this soap base is not considered a fully "clear" base (meaning you cannot see thru it like you would a crystal clear base). To achieve a super clear soap, agents have to be added that will "clear up" the naturally occurring cloudiness -- and we simply don't use those types of products in our soap. So what you get with this base, is a somewhat see-thru bar ... we call it "translucent."

            <p>Our genuine liquid Black Soap is handcrafted in small batches and imported direct from Africa. Its said to be one of the healthiest soaps for all skin types, even infants, due to the purity and simplicity of the ingredients used during production. In this easy to use liquid version, all of the crumbling issues that can be associated with the bar form of this soap, have been eliminated!

​

The ingredients used to make this soap are all hand gathered from nature, by the families that make this soap.  The soap is cooked over open fires, and the "potash" used to finish the soap comes from the fire pits.  This makes it a truly handcrafted, all natural soap!

Black soap does hold a traditional "soapy" scent that is mild. Its texture is like a "shower gel," meaning it will still run through a pump, but it's not a thin watery soap.</p>
            <p>Ingredients:  Water, Butyrospermum Parkii (unrefined shea butter), Elaeis Guineensis (unrefined palm kernel oil), potash, and cellulose gum (plant based).</p>

            <p>This glycerin soap base is one of the purest and most natural products you can find on the market. The high glycerin content will leave your skin feeling naturally soft and not chemically stripped. And the best news, is this product is made from 100% organic oils!</p>
            <p>Ingredients:  * Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, * Elaeis Guineensis (Palm) Oil, glycerin, Purified Water, ^ Sodium Hydroxide, Sorbitol, Sorbitan Oleate, and Oat Protein.

(*) denotes a certified organic ingredient.

^Please note that when soap is made by natural methods, you MUST use sodium hydroxide.  There just isn't really any other way to make a "soap."  Once the bars have been made, sodium hydroxide is no longer found in them, due to the reaction it made with the oils to create "soap."</p>

            <p>Oatmeal is one of the best skin treatments that nature has ever given us. Not only does it gently clean, but it also tones and nourishes your skin at the same time. Add that to a glycerin soap base that is designed to soften and not overly strip the skin of its natural oils, and you have a near perfect bar of soap!

We do not use surfactants or chemicals in our melt & pour bases. No SLS here!</p>

            <p>This base is the same as our "castile" melt & pour, except this bar doesn't contain the titanium dioxide that makes it a white (or a non-see thru) bar of soap. Because castile is made with a higher olive oil content, it does produce a slightly less volume of suds, but it still lathers nicely - and is extra kind and gentle to the skin!
